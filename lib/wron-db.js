//
// So a save never fails for want of a sign-in. It is kept here, on the device,
// and sent the moment there is a session. Reads show what is waiting alongside
// what the server has, so the app looks exactly as it would if the write had
// gone through, because from the person's point of view it did.
//
// This is the same shape as offline persistence in every database SDK that has
// it, and the same shape as linking an anonymous account: unsent work follows
// the person who made it into the account they sign in with. It moves only work
// that was never stored anywhere, never rows that already belong to somebody.
